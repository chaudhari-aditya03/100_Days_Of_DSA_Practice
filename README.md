# 🚀 100 Days of DSA Challenge — Aditya B. Chaudhari  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge**!  
This repository contains my daily solutions, progress, notes, and strategies as I solve **5 DSA problems every day for 100 days**.  
That's a total of **500 curated problems**, moving from **basic → advanced → interview-ready**.

This challenge helps me become a stronger problem-solver and stay consistent with my GitHub activity (hello green dots! 🟩).

# 🎯 Why I'm Doing This
- Strengthen my DSA foundation  
- Become interview-ready for top companies (Google, Amazon, Nvidia, etc.)  
- Build consistent problem-solving habits  
- Improve logical thinking & coding skills  
- Maintain a daily GitHub streak  
- Prepare for competitive exams & placements

# 📚 **DSA Learning Roadmap — 100 Days, 500 Problems**

This challenge is designed in **8 Phases**, each focusing on a major DSA skillset:

| Phase | Topic | Days |
|------|--------|------|
| Phase 1 | Arrays, Searching, Sorting, Strings, Sliding Window | Days 1–20 |
| Phase 2 | Recursion & Backtracking | Days 21–35 |
| Phase 3 | Linked Lists | Days 36–45 |
| Phase 4 | Stacks & Queues | Days 46–55 |
| Phase 5 | Trees & BST | Days 56–75 |
| Phase 6 | Graphs | Days 76–90 |
| Phase 7 | Greedy & Heaps | Days 91–95 |
| Phase 8 | Dynamic Programming | Days 96–100 |

A total of **500 structured problems** are planned — 5 every single day.
