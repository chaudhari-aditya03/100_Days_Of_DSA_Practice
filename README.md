# 🚀 100 Days of DSA Challenge — Aditya B. Chaudhari

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms Challenge**!  
This repository documents my daily progress as I solve 5 DSA problems each day for 100 days —  
a total of **500 hand-picked problems** covering everything from Arrays to Dynamic Programming.

---

## 📌 **Why I'm Doing This**
- To build strong problem-solving skills  
- To prepare for top product-based companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)  
- To stay consistent and grow my GitHub contributions  
- To become interview-ready with clean DSA fundamentals

# 📅 **Challenge Overview**
Each day I will solve **5 curated problems**, starting from **Linear DSA**, then gradually progressing to:

- ✔ Arrays  
- ✔ Searching  
- ✔ Sorting  
- ✔ Sliding Window  
- ✔ Hashing  
- ✔ Strings  
- ✔ Recursion & Backtracking  
- ✔ Linked Lists  
- ✔ Stacks & Queues  
- ✔ Trees & BST  
- ✔ Graphs  
- ✔ Greedy Algorithms  
- ✔ Heap/ Priority Queue  
- ✔ Dynamic Programming  

A total of **100 days × 5 problems/day = 500 problems** 🎯
